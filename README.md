# Advanced-Regression-Techniques

This project focused on investigating the relationship between various factors in the housing market and housing prices. The project began by inspecting a housing prices dataset, where the dataset was thoroughly examined to identify any issues or inconsistencies that would need to be addressed before proceeding with the analysis. Necessary transformations were formulated for the features and target variable to ensure the dataset was suitable for analysis.

A preprocessing and modeling pipeline was created, which included a nested cross-validation system to ensure the robustness of the results and produced accurate expectations, providing a solid foundation for the analysis.

Different modeling approaches were evaluated, such as linear and tree models.

Finally, the project identified potential areas for improvement, such as the addition of new features or further model optimization, to improve the accuracy and robustness of the results. 

This prediction model ranks in the top 10% of Kaggle's House Price Prediction Competition leaderboard and top 1% of Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users.
